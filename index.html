  <br>This is the main menu for the game; I wanted to simulate the beginnings of a new game as an introduction to the subject at hand</br>

    <h2> This paper will be about Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and one key thing that is prevelant to the story; manipulation and the effects
    of it on everyone involved, not just the victim. Take a look at this clip from Terra's route the game. Credit goes to RoxasMyHero on YouTube for this 
    clip.</h2>

    <br> To add some much needed context, in the beginning of the game, Terra had failed an important exam called the Mark of Mastery. This exam was held to determine who is
    worthy of becoming a Keyblade master. He fails because of the darkness in his heart. Xehanort, the bald guy in the clip, tells Terra he's fine as is. However, in this
    clip especially, when Terra is at his most vulnerable because he used darkness, Xehanort tells Terra what the Keyblade thinks he wants to hear and misguides him into 
    further using the darkness.
